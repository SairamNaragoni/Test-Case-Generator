 # Test-Case-Generator
* Random Array And Number generator in Matlab
* Specify the range of the numbers
* Specify the size of the array
* Specify The Size of the string
* Check If you Need Size in output
* Still There are few bugs in this version
### Usage
> For Single Line of random numbers , Select Row = 1 And Cols = N, N is no. of random numbers <br/>
> For each random number in a new line, Select Row = M And Cols = 1 , M is no. of random numbers <br />
> For 2-D Array generation of MxN, Select size as Row = M,cols = N <br />
> For Random Strings geneation , Select Size Of the String And preferences<br/>

#### Bugs
* If the size is huge (like >1000), Output is required and test cases are more than 1 then,
> Redundant white spaces are added to the output.<br/>
> Since these are test cases , white spaces doesnt effect the output.<br/>
* The menu is useless as of now, It use will be specified in the next update
