* Random Array And Number generator in Matlab
* Specify the range of the numbers
* Specify the size of the array
> For Single Line of random numbers , select Row = 1 And Cols = N, N is no. of random numbers <br/>
> For each random number in a new line, select Row = M and Cols = 1 , M is no. of random numbers <br />
> For 2-D Array generation of MxN, Select size as Row = M,cols = N <br />
